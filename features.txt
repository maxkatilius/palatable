Hue Normalization:

    For hue values, it's possible to get negative values due to some 
    operations. Although % 360 is used to keep it within bounds, 
    consider always ensuring positive values, like so:
    currentHue = (currentHue + 360) % 360;

    This ensures that if currentHue was negative, it's wrapped around 
    to its positive equivalent.

Enhancements:

    For more advanced functionality, you might also consider adding:
        Functions to export the palette in different formats (e.g., 
        as CSS variables, a downloadable image, etc.)
        Ability to generate gradients based on two or more colors 
        from the generated palettes.

Testing:

    Since these functions handle a crucial part of your application, 
    consider writing tests for them. This will ensure that changes 
    or additions to the codebase don't accidentally introduce bugs 
    into the palette generation. Testing random functions can be 
    challenging, but you can still test boundaries, extreme values, 
    and expected types.

Optimization:

    In terms of performance, these functions should be pretty fast 
    and capable of generating palettes instantaneously. However, if
    you're looking to further optimize, you can analyze which parts
    of the code run the most frequently and see if there are more 
    efficient algorithms or methods to achieve the same result.


    Historical Palettes:

    In addition to famous painting palettes, consider adding palettes from different eras or cultures (e.g., Victorian-era colors, Ancient Egyptian colors, etc.).

Colorblindness Filters:

    Add options to simulate and create palettes that are colorblind-friendly. This can help ensure palettes are accessible to a wider range of users.

    Favorite Colors:

    Allow users to mark some colors as their favorites and access these favorite colors in the settings, so they can quickly generate palettes with their preferred colors.

    Color Mood or Emotion:

    Allow users to generate palettes based on moods or emotions (e.g., calm, energetic, moody, etc.). You can assign certain colors or harmonies to different moods.

        Integration with Image Upload:

    Enable users to upload an image, and then extract a palette from it. This can be achieved using libraries or APIs that can extract dominant colors from images.
